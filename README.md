# JavaCalculator
Java Intern Day 1
I have created a Calcualtor class 
It has 4 member functions add,subtract,multiply and divide
I have used double datatype to use decimal values
i have also handled the division by zero error using Double.NaN where Double is a wrapper class for double datatype and it has some default methods like Double.NaN which means not a number 
My code returns NaN if division by zero happens to ensure runtime correctness
I have used a while loop with a boolean variable it is set to true intially and when an user chooses option 5 from the menu it becomes fales and exits out of the program.
